# Aim

To study and implement Constructor Overloading in C++.

Software Used

Visual Studio

# Theory

In C++, a class can have multiple constructors with the same name (the class name) but with different argument lists. This concept is known as Constructor Overloading and is similar to Function Overloading.

Each overloaded constructor is distinguished by the number and type of parameters it accepts. When an object is created, the compiler determines which constructor to call based on the arguments passed during object creation.

# Key Points:

Constructor overloading allows multiple ways of initializing an object.

It provides flexibility and reduces the need for multiple setter methods or complex initialization logic.

Initialization logic is encapsulated inside constructors, improving code readability and maintainability.

Copy constructors (a type of overloaded constructor) allow for both shallow and deep copies of objects, simplifying object duplication.

# Note on Operator Overloading

Although unrelated to constructor overloading, operator overloading is another form of compile-time polymorphism in C++. It allows redefining the behavior of existing operators (such as +, -, *, etc.) when used with user-defined types like classes, giving them special meaning without changing their fundamental purpose.

# Benefits of Constructor Overloading

Flexibility in Object Initialization:
Provides multiple ways to initialize an object, offering convenience and adaptability.

Cleaner and More Readable Code:
Reduces redundancy, avoids multiple setter calls, and simplifies object creation, leading to more maintainable code.

Encapsulation of Initialization Logic:
Keeps all initialization logic inside constructors, preventing it from being scattered across multiple methods.

Support for Copy Constructors:
Enables cloning of objects (shallow or deep copying) in a controlled manner.

# Implementation

To demonstrate Constructor Overloading in C++, the following examples are used:

Constructor overloading for calculating volume and area

Object initialization using different constructors

Operator overloading (for demonstration of compile-time polymorphism)


The above implementations illustrate the concept of Constructor Overloading in C++, showing how it provides multiple ways to initialize objects efficiently and improves code readability and maintainability
